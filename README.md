# Fobi

A project from Iterate's Shipit 2019. Co-created with Camilla Dahlstrøm and Line Holmen. We wanted to visualize Store norske leksikons page on [phobias](https://snl.no/fobi). The project can be seen at [https://fobi.herokuapp.com](https://fobi.herokuapp.com).

## Setup
Requires npm or yarn

After cloning the repo, run:
```
$ cd fobi
$ yarn install //if you have yarn, or use npm
$ yarn start (or npm run start)
```

That's it!
